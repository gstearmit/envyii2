PHP dotenv
==========

Loads environment variables from `.env` to `getenv()`, `$_ENV` and
`$_SERVER` automagically.

Installation with Composer
--------------------------

```shell
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar require vlucas/phpdotenv
```

Usage
-----
The `.env` file is generally kept out of version control since it can contain
sensitive API keys and passwords. A separate `.env.example` file is created
with all the required environment variables defined except for the sensitive
ones, which are either user-supplied for their own development environments or
are communicated elsewhere to project collaborators. The project collaborators
then independently copy the `.env.example` file to a local `.env` and ensure
all the settings are correct for their local environment, filling in the secret
keys or providing their own values when necessary. In this usage, the `.env`
file should be added to the project's `.gitignore` file so that it will never
be committed by collaborators.  This usage ensures that no sensitive passwords
or API keys will ever be in the version control history so there is less risk
of a security breach, and production values will never have to be shared with
all project collaborators.

Add your application configuration to a `.env` file in the root of your
project. **Make sure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` so it is not
checked-in the code**

```shell
S3_BUCKET="dotenv"
SECRET_KEY="souper_seekret_key"
```

Now create a file named `.env.example` and check this into the project. This
should have the ENV variables you need to have set, but the values should
either be blank or filled with dummy data. The idea is to let people know what
variables are required, but not give them the sensitive production values.

```shell
S3_BUCKET="devbucket"
SECRET_KEY="abc123"
```

You can then load `.env` in your application with:

```php
$dotenv = new Dotenv\Dotenv(__DIR__);
$dotenv->load();
```

Optionally you can pass in a filename as the second parameter, if you would like to use something other than `.env`

```php
$dotenv = new Dotenv\Dotenv(__DIR__, 'myconfig');
$dotenv->load();
```

All of the defined variables are now accessible with the `getenv`
method, and are available in the `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` super-globals.

```php
$s3_bucket = getenv('S3_BUCKET');
$s3_bucket = $_ENV['S3_BUCKET'];
$s3_bucket = $_SERVER['S3_BUCKET'];
```

You should also be able to access them using your framework's Request
class (if you are using a framework).

```php
$s3_bucket = $request->env('S3_BUCKET');
$s3_bucket = $request->getEnv('S3_BUCKET');
$s3_bucket = $request->server->get('S3_BUCKET');
$s3_bucket = env('S3_BUCKET');
```

### Nesting Variables

It's possible to nest an environment variable within another, useful to cut
down on repetition.

This is done by wrapping an existing environment variable in `${â€¦}` e.g.

```shell
BASE_DIR="/var/webroot/project-root"
CACHE_DIR="${BASE_DIR}/cache"
TMP_DIR="${BASE_DIR}/tmp"
```

### Immutability

By default, Dotenv will NOT overwrite existing environment variables that are
already set in the environment.

If you want Dotenv to overwrite existing environment variables, use `overload`
instead of `load`:

```php
$dotenv = new Dotenv\Dotenv(__DIR__);
$dotenv->overload();
```

Requiring Variables to be Set
-----------------------------

Using Dotenv, you can require specific ENV vars to be defined, and throw
an Exception if they are not. This is particularly useful to let people know
any explicit required variables that your app will not work without.

You can use a single string:

```php
$dotenv->required('DATABASE_DSN');
```

Or an array of strings:

```php
$dotenv->required(['DB_HOST', 'DB_NAME', 'DB_USER', 'DB_PASS']);
```

If any ENV vars are missing, Dotenv will throw a `RuntimeException` like this:

```
One or more environment variables failed assertions: DATABASE_DSN is missing
```

### Empty Variables

Beyond simply requiring a variable to be set, you might also need to ensure the
variable is not empty:

```php
$dotenv->required('DATABASE_DSN')->notEmpty();
```

If the environment variable is empty, you'd get an Exception:

```
One or more environment variables failed assertions: DATABASE_DSN is empty
```

### Integer Variables

You might also need to ensure the the variable is of an integer value. You may do the following:

```php
$dotenv->required('FOO')->isInteger();
```

If the environment variable is not an integer, you'd get an Exception:

```
One or more environment variables failed assertions: FOO is not an integer
```

### Allowed Values

It is also possible to define a set of values that your environment variable
should be. This is especially useful in situations where only a handful of
options or drivers are actually supported by your code:

```php
$dotenv->required('SESSION_STORE')->allowedValues(['Filesystem', 'Memcached']);
```

If the environment variable wasn't in this list of allowed values, you'd get a
similar Exception:

```
One or more environment variables failed assertions: SESSION_STORE is not an
allowed value
```

### Comments

You can comment your `.env` file using the `#` character. E.g.

```shell
# this is a comment
VAR="value" # comment
VAR=value # comment
```



```
source .env
```
